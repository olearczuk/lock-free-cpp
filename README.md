[Can Seqlocks Get Along With Programming Language Memory Models](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506174408/https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2012/HPL-2012-68.pdf) â€” *Hans-J. Boehm*

<summary>Zero Sticky Counter</summary>

Sticky counter is a concurrent counter that never goes below zero. Once the counter reaches zero, it becomes "sticky" and can not be incremented ago.<br/>
Inspiration comes from [Introduction to Wait-free Algorithms in C++ Programming - Daniel Anderson - CppCon 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPh8pod0-gk&list=PLr05g8IRfRd6kAxBpmpGsijzlVLCuuPqZ)

### LockFreeZeroStickyCounter - [src/lock_free_zero_sticky_counter.hpp](src/lock_free_zero_sticky_counter.hpp)
It avoids locks by using atomic operations, making it suitable for high-performance, multi-threaded environments.

### WaitFreeZeroStickyCounter - [src/wait_free_zero_sticky_counter.hpp](src/wait_free_zero_sticky_counter.hpp)
Same as `LockFreeZeroStickyCounter` but it's wait-free instead.

<summary>Single Producer Single Consumer Queue - <a href="src/spsc_queue.hpp">src/spsc_queue.hpp</a></summary>

Lock-free implementation of Single Producer Single Consumer Queue.<br/>
Inspiration comes from [Single Producer Single Consumer Lock-free FIFO From the Ground Up - Charles Frasch - CppCon 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3P_Lmq6pw0&list=PLr05g8IRfRd51NGMQ-9X_BuTHHhzro5P0) as well as [Erik Rigtorp's SPSCQueue implementation](https://github.com/rigtorp/SPSCQueue/tree/master)

<summary>Multi Producer Multi Consumer Queue - <a href="src/mpmc_queue.hpp">src/mpmc_queue.hpp</a></summary>

Lock-free implementation of Multi Producer Multi Consumer Queue.<br/>
Inspiration comes from [User API and C++ Implementation of a Multi Producer, Multi Consumer, Lock Free, Atomic Queue - Erez Strauss - CppCon 2024
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjz_bMNNWRk), my implementation is a more basic version of Erez's implementation.
